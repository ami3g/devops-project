# devops-project
This project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline. Using Terraform for IaC and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, I will automate the deployment of a scalable, resilient web app on AWS. The architecture includes automated scaling and monitoring via CloudWatch, showcasing my full-lifecycle approach to cloud operations. I hope this works!
